SENR
====

SENR is for `Sleep. Execute. Notify. Repeat.`.  The program repeats executing
commands and notifying the results of the executions to user as configured with
sleep between iterations.  It is similar with `crond` but specialized for
repetitive execution and notification.  In actual, the first goal of the
program was system monitoring.  One user may use the program to `ping` its
server systems and send mail to him if the `ping` was not successful.
